## 🚀 About Me
I’m Motayyab Jabbar, a Software Engineering graduate from COMSATS University Islamabad (Vehari Campus), with a strong focus on frontend development and UI/UX design.

I specialize in building modern, responsive, and scalable web and mobile applications using **React.js**, **Flutter**, and **Firebase**. I’ve successfully delivered academic and freelance projects across platforms, and I’m passionate about clean code, design consistency, and user-centric solutions.

My experience includes both individual and team-based development, and I actively contribute to open-source and self-driven projects. I’m currently seeking full-time roles or freelance opportunities where I can apply my skills and grow as a frontend developer.
